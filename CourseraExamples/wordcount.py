# In Part 2, the mapper function tokenizes each document and emits a key-value pair. 
# The key is a word formatted as a string and the value is the integer 1 to indicate an occurrence of word.
def mapper(record):
    # key: document identifier
    # value: document contents
    key = record[0]
    value = record[1]

    for w in words:
      mr.emit_intermediate(w, 1)

# In Part 3, the reducer function sums up the list of occurrence counts and emits a count for word. 
# Since the mapper function emits the integer 1 for each word, each element in the list_of_values is the integer 1.
# The list of occurrence counts is summed and a (word, total) tuple is emitted where word is a string and total is an integer.

    # key: word
